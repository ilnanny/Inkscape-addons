:PRINT_USAGE
echo.
echo setup_win [/D:InkscapePath] [/P:SetupPara]
echo Tries to install the TexText extension using the Python distribution
echo shipped with Inkscape and the Python script setup.py. In fact this is
echo only a wrapper around setup.py which ensures that Python is correctly
echo identified in the Inkscape installation. If you have a system wide
echo Python installation you can directly call setup.py using that installation.
echo.
echo Usage:
echo ======
echo setup_win
echo Installs TexText with the default options and using the Python installation
echo shipped with Inkscape. Installation fails if no Inkscape is detected by the
echo script or Inkscape has been installed without Python or the requirements to
echo use TexText are not met. In the last case the script lists the steps to
echo be done for an successfull installation.
echo.
echo setup_win /D:"C:\Path\to\Inkscape installation\"
echo Installs TexText with the default options assuming that Inkscape is located
echo in the directory "C:\Path\to\Inkscape installation\". This syntax is only
echo required if you have not installed Inkscape via an installer but from a
echo zip package.
echo.
echo setup_win /P:"--option1 'value 1' --option2 'value 2'"
echo Installs TexText using the Python distribution shipped with
echo Inkscape and directly passes the parameter string
echo --option1 "value 1 --option2 "value 2" to setup.py. You can pass any
echo parameters understood by setup.py. Note the single quotes enclosing
echo white space containing option values in the _batch_ file call!!
echo.
echo You can combine the last two calling syntaxes, of course.
echo.
echo Example:
echo setup_win.bat /d:"C:\Program Files\Inkscape" /p:"--ghostscript-executable
echo 'C:\Program Files\gs\gs.exe' --pstoedit-executable
echo 'C:\Program Files\pstoedit\pstoedit.exe'"
