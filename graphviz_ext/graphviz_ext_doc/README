GraphViz Extension for Inkscape
Copyright (C) 2017 Thomas Flynn <tflynn@gradcenter.cuny.edu>
Based on EqTexSvg by Julien Vitard <julienvitard@gmail.com>

To use this plugin, you will need to install GraphViz http://www.graphviz.org/,
which provides the dot command that turns graph specifications into image files.

To install the plugin, place myext.inx and myext.py into the extensions folder
of your inkscape installation.

To access the plugin, goto Extensions -> Render -> Graphviz. Enter the absolute
path of your dot file and press Apply to see the output of Graphviz on your
canvas.

A sample graph 'cycle.dot' is provided.

The plugin was tested with Inkscape 0.48 on Linux.
