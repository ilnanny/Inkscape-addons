==============

Triangular and perspective grid creation extensions for inkscape

Usage
-----


Copy the *.inx and *.py files in to your Inkscape extensions directory (usually ~/.configure/inkscape/extensions).  The actual directory can be found under Preferences/System/User preferences.

Note: on my Mac (OSX Mountain Lion 10.8.5) the Inkscape extensions directory is
~/.config/inkscape/extensions

Restart inkscape.

The grids will be available under Effects/Render.
